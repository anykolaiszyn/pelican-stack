# .env.example
# Environment variables for Pelican Panel Docker Compose setup (using ghcr.io/pelican-dev/panel image)

# --- Pelican Panel & Caddy Configuration ---

# Application URL
# IMPORTANT: Set this to the publicly accessible URL of your panel.
# If using HTTPS (recommended), Caddy will attempt to automatically obtain an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
# Example for HTTPS: APP_URL=https://panel.yourdomain.com
# Example for HTTP: APP_URL=http://localhost
APP_URL=http://localhost

# Administrator Email
# IMPORTANT: This email is used by Caddy (the integrated web server) for Let's Encrypt SSL certificate registration.
# Replace with your actual email address.
ADMIN_EMAIL=youremail@example.com

# --- Port Configuration (Optional) ---
# Default ports are 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). 
# You generally don't need to change these unless you have port conflicts or are running behind another reverse proxy on the same host.
# APP_PORT_HTTP=80
# APP_PORT_HTTPS=443

# --- Docker Network Configuration (Optional) ---
# Default subnet for the Docker network.
# Change this if it conflicts with your existing Docker network configurations.
# DOCKER_SUBNET=172.20.0.0/16

# --- Pelican Panel Specific Environment Variables (from image documentation) ---
# XDG_DATA_HOME is set in docker-compose.yml and typically doesn't need to be changed here.
# XDG_DATA_HOME=/pelican-data

# For other Pelican Panel configurations (e.g., mail, cache, session, queue drivers if not using defaults),
# you would typically configure them through the panel's web installer or admin settings once it's running,
# or if the image supports them, by adding more P_... environment variables as per Pelican documentation for that image.
# The ghcr.io/pelican-dev/panel image defaults to SQLite, Filesystem cache/session, and Database queue.
